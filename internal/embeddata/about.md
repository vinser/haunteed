# *Haunteed*

## Overview
**Haunteed** is a parody night-shift horror game for sysadmins, inspired by the feeling of being the only human in a datacenter at 3 AM.  
It's not a simulation, it's not serious — it’s a retro-style distraction while you wait for your scripts to finish or your backups to fail.

## Requirements
- A keyboard (mechanical, preferably loud)
- A terminal (dark background recommended, green text optional)
- A sysadmin mindset: paranoia, caffeine, and root privileges (in real life only)

## Gameplay
- You are the night guard of a haunted IT facility.
- Navigate through the maze-like environment using your arrow keys.
- Collect the “normal” things (like crumbs and pellets).
- Avoid the not-so-normal things (you will recognize them).
- If something looks like a process running forever, it probably is.
- **Don’t forget the lights**:
  - Lights save your sanity (and maybe your uptime).
  - Just like in real life: if you leave them off too long, something weird will happen.
  - ⚠️  **RTFM WARNING**: admins who forget to toggle lights are doomed to debug in darkness forever. And yes, that includes production at 4 AM.

## Tips for Sysadmins
- **Esc** is not just a key — it’s a lifestyle.
- Ghosts don’t respect firewall rules.
- The scariest log is the one that’s empty.
- UPS doesn’t mean “Uninterruptible Paranormal Supply.”
- Pellets are like **sudo**: they help to kill bugs and penetrate maze firewalls. Use them wisely, or regret later.
- **Pro Tip:** Playing *Haunteed* on a production server is technically possible… but your coworkers might not appreciate your high scores.

It’s just for fun.  
Play it during night shifts, but don’t let the monitoring alerts pile up.  

**P.S.** In `crazy` mode with `real` enabled, the game will ping http://ip-api.com to guess your location. I promise it’s only for night-shift math, not for selling your soul.
