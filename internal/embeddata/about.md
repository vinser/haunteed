# *Haunteed*

## TUI Night-Shift Horror for Sysadmins
**Haunteed** is a love letter to that special feeling of being the only human in a data center at 3 AM. It's not a simulation, it's not serious—it's a retro-styled timekiller while your scripts run or your backups fail spectacularly.

## System Requirements
- A keyboard (mechanical, preferably loud)
- A terminal (dark background recommended, green text optional)
- A sysadmin mindset: paranoia, caffeine, and root privileges (IRL only)

## How to Play
- You are the night watchman of a haunted IT facility.
- Navigate the server maze using your arrow keys.
- Collect the "normal" stuff (like crumbs and pellets).
- Avoid the "not-normal" stuff (you'll know it when you see it).
- If it looks like a process running forever, it probably is.
- **Rule #1: MANAGE THE LIGHTS**:
  - Lights save your sanity (and maybe your uptime).
  - Just like IRL: leave them off too long, and weird stuff happens.
  - ⚠️  **RTFM WARNING**: Admins who forget to toggle lights are doomed to debug in darkness forever. Yes, that includes production at 4 AM.

## Tips for Survival
- **Esc** is not just a key — it’s a lifestyle.
- The crazy basement always spells doom.
- Ghosts don’t respect firewall rules.
- The scariest log is the one that’s empty.
- Never sell your life for breadcrumbs.
- UPS doesn’t mean “Uninterruptible Paranormal Supply.”
- Pellets are like **sudo**:—they kill bugs and breach maze firewalls. Use wisely.
- **Pro Tip:** Playing *Haunteed* on a production server is technically possible… but your SRE won’t appreciate your high scores.

It’s just for fun.  
Play it during night shifts, but don’t let the monitoring alerts pile up.  

**P.S.** In `crazy` mode with `real` enabled, the game pings http://ip-api.com to guess your location. I promise it’s only for night-shift math, not for selling your soul.  

**P.P.S.** Some say the secrets to the high salary are hidden in the source code. Others just read the damn MOTD.
